# One-to-Many Relationships

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/data-modeling-deep-dive/data-relationships/one-to-many-relationships" />

üë®‚Äçüíº We need to add the `Notes` model to our schema. This is a one-to-many
relationship. A `User` can have many `Notes`, but a `Note` can only have one
`User` (who we call an "owner").

Please add the `Notes` model to <InlineFile file="prisma/schema.prisma" />

The emoji will be in there to help guide you through this.

üí∞ Note, if you get stuck on the syntax, remember you can check
the <Link to="?preview=diff">Diff Tab</Link> to check your work against the
solution.

	If you've installed the Prisma VSCode extension, it will automatically format
	your schema which is great. It also even completes some of the relationship
	syntax for you which is also great. However, it will also automatically
	capitalize the property names it adds which is annoying. Just double check the
	User model to make sure the property is lowercase `notes` and not `Notes`.

Great, with your schema ready to go, you can now push your updated schema to the
database:

```sh nonumber
npx prisma db push
```

And then you can open Prisma Studio and you'll find your new `Notes` model:

```sh nonumber
npx prisma studio
```

Try to manually create a new note and associate it with a user.

Beware of the extension auto-updating to capital letters in model
