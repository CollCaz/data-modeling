👨‍💼 Terrific work! You should be proud of yourself! Give yourself a pat on the
back! (I would, but I'm just a 👨‍💼 emoji).

🦉 I want to call out that until we added the `order by` we didn't need to use
`prisma.$queryRaw`. Prisma is pretty powerful by itself and most of the time you
don't need to reach for raw SQL statements. But when you do, you'll be glad that
you could.

## Typed SQL

An exciting new feature in Prisma 5.19.0 is the `prisma.$queryRawTyped`
function. This allows you to run raw SQL queries and get typed results back
from your database.

This is a game changer for type safety and developer experience. Check out how
this exercise changes with this new feature here:
