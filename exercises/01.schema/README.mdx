# Database Schema

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/data-modeling-deep-dive/database-schema/intro-to-database-schema" />

SQLite uses SQL for querying the database. SQL stands for Structured Query
Language and is a language used to communicate with the most widely used
databases.

A primitive concept in SQL is a table. A table is a collection of rows and
columns. Each row represents a single entity, and each column represents a
property of that entity.

Here's an example of SQL to create the SQLite tables for an application (don't
bother reading into this too much just yet, skim over it):

```sql nocopy
CREATE TABLE "User" (
    "id" TEXT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    "email" TEXT NOT NULL,
    "username" TEXT NOT NULL,
    "name" TEXT,
    "createdAt" DATETIME NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    "updatedAt" DATETIME NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE "Sandwich" (
    "id" TEXT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    "name" TEXT NOT NULL,
    "description" TEXT NOT NULL,
    "price" REAL NOT NULL,
    "createdAt" DATETIME NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    "updatedAt" DATETIME NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE "Order" (
    "id" TEXT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    "userId" TEXT NOT NULL,
    "createdAt" DATETIME NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    "updatedAt" DATETIME NOT NULL,
    "status" TEXT NOT NULL, -- For example: "Preparing", "Ready", "Delivered"
    CONSTRAINT "Order_userId_fkey" FOREIGN KEY ("userId") REFERENCES "User" ("id") ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE
);

CREATE TABLE "OrderItem" (
    "id" TEXT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    "orderId" TEXT NOT NULL,
    "sandwichId" TEXT NOT NULL,
    "quantity" INTEGER NOT NULL,
    "createdAt" DATETIME NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    "updatedAt" DATETIME NOT NULL,
    CONSTRAINT "OrderItem_orderId_fkey" FOREIGN KEY ("orderId") REFERENCES "Order" ("id") ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE,
    CONSTRAINT "OrderItem_sandwichId_fkey" FOREIGN KEY ("sandwichId") REFERENCES "Sandwich" ("id") ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE
);

CREATE TABLE "Ingredient" (
    "id" TEXT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    "name" TEXT NOT NULL,
    "createdAt" DATETIME NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    "updatedAt" DATETIME NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE "SandwichIngredient" (
    "id" TEXT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    "sandwichId" TEXT NOT NULL,
    "ingredientId" TEXT NOT NULL,
    "createdAt" DATETIME NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    "updatedAt" DATETIME NOT NULL,
    CONSTRAINT "SandwichIngredient_sandwichId_fkey" FOREIGN KEY ("sandwichId") REFERENCES "Sandwich" ("id") ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE,
    CONSTRAINT "SandwichIngredient_ingredientId_fkey" FOREIGN KEY ("ingredientId") REFERENCES "Ingredient" ("id") ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE
);
```

I used to be a Business Intelligence engineer, so this was a common sight for
me, but to be honest, I'm not super jazzed to see it again ðŸ˜† Especially when
you consider the desire to change things over time (migrate the database).

## Prisma

This is where [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io) comes in really handy. Prisma is a
suite of tools that allow you to manage your database and communicate with it
more easily in your JavaScript application.

One feature of Prisma is the ORM which stands for "Object Relational Mapper".
This allows you to interact with your database using JavaScript objects and
function calls instead of SQL. (ðŸ¦º And the best part is it's all typesafe!).
We'll get to that part later on in the workshop though.

### Prisma Schema

Another feature of Prisma is its schema language. This is a language that
allows you to define your database schema in a way that is more human readable
and easier to manage than SQL. It allows you to define relationships between
tables, and it allows you to define the types of each column. It also helps you
to manage migrations (changes in the schema, which we'll get to later).

Here's how you'd define the schema for that same database in Prisma:

```prisma filename=prisma/schema.prisma nocopy
model User {
  id        String   @id @default(uuid())
  email     String   @unique
  username  String
  name      String?
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt
  orders    Order[]
}

model Sandwich {
  id                  String               @id @default(uuid())
  name                String
  description         String
  price               Float
  createdAt           DateTime             @default(now())
  updatedAt           DateTime             @updatedAt
  orderItems          OrderItem[]
  sandwichIngredients SandwichIngredient[]
}

model Order {
  id         String      @id @default(uuid())
  createdAt  DateTime    @default(now())
  updatedAt  DateTime    @updatedAt
  status     String
  userId     String
  user       User        @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
  orderItems OrderItem[]
}

model OrderItem {
  id         String   @id @default(uuid())
  quantity   Int
  createdAt  DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt  DateTime @updatedAt
  orderId    String
  order      Order    @relation(fields: [orderId], references: [id])
  sandwichId String
  sandwich   Sandwich @relation(fields: [sandwichId], references: [id])
}

model Ingredient {
  id                  String               @id @default(uuid())
  name                String
  createdAt           DateTime             @default(now())
  updatedAt           DateTime             @updatedAt
  sandwichIngredients SandwichIngredient[]
}

model SandwichIngredient {
  id           String     @id @default(uuid())
  createdAt    DateTime   @default(now())
  updatedAt    DateTime   @updatedAt
  sandwichId   String
  sandwich     Sandwich   @relation(fields: [sandwichId], references: [id])
  ingredientId String
  ingredient   Ingredient @relation(fields: [ingredientId], references: [id])
}
```

This will also automatically create critical indexes on the tables to improve
typical query performance.

### Prisma CLI

Another feature of Prisma is a CLI that you can use to manage your database with
your schema. So you can convert this schema into SQL and run it against your
database to create the tables. You can also use it to generate the ORM client.

To generate the SQL and run it on your database, you'll run:

```sh nonumber
npx prisma db push
```

And if you already have a database, you can go the reverse direction: generate
the schema from the database:

```sh nonumber
npx prisma db pull
```

There's much more to it all, but let's get started with this first.

### Prisma Studio

Another great feature of Prisma is the ability to view and edit your database
using a web interface. This is called Prisma Studio. You can run it with:

```sh nonumber
npx prisma studio
```

This will open your browser in a special web app for exploring your database
model.
