# Seeding Data

Seeding data means to create data in your database that you can use to test your
application. It's also useful for initializing your database with data that you
know you'll need.

## Seeding SQLite Data in Development

During development, it's much more useful to have data to work with. You can
definitely use your own UI (or Prisma Studio) to add data to the database
manually, but this may make you cry when you accidentally reset your database
ðŸ˜­.

Instead, you'll want to have a script that can reset your database. Typically
it's best for this script to be idempotent. Meaning you can run it as many times
as you like and you get the same desired result. So, typically you want this
script to delete all the data in your database and then re-create it from
scratch. If you make your seed script rely on existing data in the database
you'll start looking for a way to seed your seed script! What a mess!

Another benefit of writing a seed script is you can set the IDs of your records
so every time you run the seed script you can have some predictability in the
IDs of your records which makes it easier to navigate around the app
consistently.

## Seeding SQLite Data in Production

For example, if you're building an application that allows users to lookup the
nearest city with a certain population threshold from their geographic location,
you'll need to have a database of cities with their population and geographic
coordinates. You could manually enter this data into your database, but that
would be tedious and error prone. Instead, you can write a script that will
populate your database with the data you need.

The easiest way to seed production data is to use the `sqlite3` command line
tool. You can use raw SQL, or write a script like we'll do in this exercise,
generate the database file you like, and then copy it to your production
environment.

It's surprisingly straightforward to do production DB seeding with SQLite ðŸ˜…

If you have existing data in your production database and you'd like to seed it
with more data, then it's a tiny bit more involved.

1. Backup your production database (lol).
1. Create a new database file (locally) with the data you want to seed.
1. Create a "dump" of the seed database using the `sqlite3` command line tool.
   ```sh nonumber
   sqlite3 seed.db .dump > seed.sql
   ```
1. Copy the `seed.sql` file to your production volume next to your database
   (via `sftp`)
1. SSH into your production server and run the following command:
   ```sh nonumber
   sqlite3 data.db < seed.sql
   ```
1. Verify that your production database has been seeded correctly. If it hasn't,
   then restore your backup (asap).

<callout-warning>
	You may need to adjust some of the SQL generated by the `.dump` command to
	allow you to update the database without issue. It will have `CREATE TABLE`
	commands which should include `IF NOT EXISTS`, but the `CREATE UNIQUE INDEX`
	commands will not. You'll need to add `IF NOT EXISTS` to those commands
	manually, or remove them entirely.

## Prisma Seed

Prisma's CLI has built-in support for a seed script. It will run you seed script
after running dev migrate subcommands like `npx prisma migrate dev` and
`npx prisma migrate reset`. You can also run it manually with
`npx prisma db seed`.

But first it must be configured in the `package.json`:

```json
"prisma": {
  "seed": "npx tsx prisma/seed.ts"
}
```

Whatever the `seed` property is set to will be what is run.
