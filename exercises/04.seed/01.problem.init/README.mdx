# Init Seed Script

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/data-modeling-deep-dive/seeding-data/configuring-prisma-for-seed-script-execution" />

👨‍💼 Let's get our seed script going. We already created
a <InlineFile file="prisma/seed.ts" /> file when we added images to our
database, so we just need to configure prisma to run this file when we run
development migrate commands and on demand when we call `npx prisma db seed`.

🐨 Add this config to the `package.json`:

```json
"prisma": {
  "seed": "npx tsx prisma/seed.ts"
},
```

👨‍💼 Great. Now you should be able to run `npx prisma db seed` and see the images
in your database.

However, we want to make our seed script idempotent so it doesn't just keep
filling our database with data. It's nice to be able to run the seed script as a
way to start fresh.

So check the emoji in <InlineFile file="prisma/seed.ts" /> to update it to
delete the data at the start of the script and create all new data every time
it's run.

🐨 Once you've done that, try running

```sh nonumber
npx prisma migrate reset
```

Then open up Prisma studio with

```sh nonumber
npx prisma studio
```

Now you should have a fresh database with a user, a post, and two images/files.
