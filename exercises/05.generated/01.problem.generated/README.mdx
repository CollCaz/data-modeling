👨‍💼 It's nice to have our hard-coded user that we can rely on during development,
but it would be nice to have more data, so let's generate it!

For this first exercise, use `faker` to generate fake data for one additional
user.

The emoji should help you out here. Also, you should probably keep the Faker
API Reference documentation open.

🐨 When you're done, seed the database:

```sh nonumber
npx prisma db seed
```

🐨 And then open up the Prisma Studio to see your generated data:

```sh nonumber
npx prisma studio
```
