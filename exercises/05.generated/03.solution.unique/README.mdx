👨‍💼 Great work. Thank you for doing that. Our seed script is now pretty awesome!

💯 For extra credit, if you've got some time, go ahead and move some of the
hard-coded notes data for Kody from <InlineFile file="app/utils/db.server.ts" />
to <InlineFile file="prisma/seed.ts" />. If you don't, 🧝‍♂️ Kellie will do it for
you.
