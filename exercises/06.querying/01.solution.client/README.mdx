# Setup App Client

👨‍💼 Terrific work 👏 Now we can start querying our _real_ database for data
instead of the fake old one 🎉 Let's get started on that next.

💯 For extra credit, update
the <InlineFile file="app/routes/resources+/images.$imageId.tsx" /> file to use
the new prisma client to find images before continuing to the next step.
Otherwise, 🧝‍♂️ Kellie will do it for you. Tip: Kellie makes two similar but
different files for handling user and note images separately.
