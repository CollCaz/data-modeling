👨‍💼 Great, we've optimized things nicely for our queries!

	Notice that the types of the user are inferred from the `select` statement.
	Combine this with the fact that our loader data is inferred from what we
	return in the loader and that means you get type safety from the database all
	the way to the UI. This is *incredibly* powerful. Try to remove a field and
	you'll immediately get red squiggles! Amazing.
