# Setup App Client

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/data-modeling-deep-dive/querying-data/connecting-to-a-real-database-with-prisma-and-sqlite" />

👨‍💼 We are _finally_ ready to start using our new SQLite database in our
application. We've already created a `PrismaClient` in our seed script, but now
we want to access our SQLite data in our application.

We're going to keep the old in-memory database around until we've migrated
everything over, so just stick this new client above it at the top
of <InlineFile file="app/utils/db.server.ts" />.

You'll need to handle HMR (as described in the background info for this
exercise) using the `singleton` helper.

We also want you to add logging for all Prisma queries, but we want to
customize this so it only logs the slower queries so we can make sense of our
logs. The emoji will help you out with that, but
[here are the logging docs](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client/working-with-prismaclient/logging).

Finally, we'll also want to pre-connect our client since we start making
database queries right away and there's no benefit to the default lazy
connection.

The emoji will be your guide!
