# Foreign Keys

üë®‚Äçüíº I'm against pre-mature optimization as much as the next person, but I also
like to apply best practices when I'm aware of them. It sounds like adding an
index for our foreign keys is a generally good idea, so let's go ahead and do
that.

Before we do, let's see what SQLite will do with our typical query using the
`EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN` command.

<callout-info>
	For methods on how to run this command, see the "Running SQL commands" section
	of the background information for this exercise.
</callout-info>

üê® Execute this command:

```sql
EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN
SELECT * from note where ownerId = 1;
```

This gives us the following output:

```
QUERY PLAN
`--SCAN note
```

That `SCAN` without an index says we're going to be reading every row in the
note database looking for the ones that match our `ownerId`. Once we get a lot
of notes, this could definitely end up being slow.

This applies to all our foreign keys as well. Everywhere we are using the
`@relation` attribute should have an index for the foreign key. Let's add those.

üê® Once you're done updating the `schema.prisma` file, go ahead and create the
migration script:

```sh nonumber
npx prisma migrate dev
```

You could call it "foreign-key-indexes".

üê® Once you've done that, try running the `EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN` command again.

You should see something like this:

```
QUERY PLAN
`--SEARCH note USING INDEX Note_ownerId_idx (ownerId=?)
```

Much better! Now we don't have to read every note to find the ones that match
our `ownerId`. Instead the database will reference the index and only read those
rows. This will help our CPU and memory utilization for these queries.
