# Delete

👨‍💼 This first part of the exercise is going to be a bit on the easy side,
because the update note bit is going to be a little more complicated 😅

Please migrate our delete note functionality from the in-memory `db` to our
`prisma` client.

<callout-info>
	Now that you're able to delete notes, keep in mind you can always restore them
	by re-running the `seed` command: `npx prisma db seed`. You do not need to
	restart the server to see changes.
